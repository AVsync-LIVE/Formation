# Formation

Formation is styled component library based around the Unimpeded Interface design system.

### The Unimpeded Interface Philosophy 

Formation is a Styled Components library that conforms to the Unimpeded Interface Philosophy. 

### Core principals
 - No right clicks
 - Touchscreen-first
 - Allow for hold-to-drag, but also allow for tap/click-only alternatives
 - Responsive from the smallest of phones to the largest of multi-window 4K monitors.
 - Animations should be minimal or avoided, as they can degrade performance and make interactions feel less responsive.
 - Easily modify the styling using interchangeable themes.
 - Prefer a small inline dropdown over a context-dominating modal popup.


### Implementation

 - Surface-based background-color system
 - CSS variables
 - React Styled-components
 - Use of storybook to manage and visualize components outside of an application
 - Code sandbox examples for all components
